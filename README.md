This repository contains notebook for a newbie programmer who might need to know a few things in algorithms and Data structures

This journey is simply the self-check exercises in the python course offered on [runestone](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html) which explain some very important consideration on algorithms and data structures with a focus on the Python programming language.

This site may also be a good place to begin for someone who needs to learn Python from scratch.
